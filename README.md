packages-report
===============

The goal of packages-report is to show the state of the R packages installed on the machine.

I have 224 add-on packages installed.

Here's how they break down in terms of which version of R they were built under, which is related to how recently they were updated on CRAN.

| Built |    n|       prop|
|:------|----:|----------:|
| 3.5.0 |  222|  0.9910714|
| 3.5.1 |    2|  0.0089286|
